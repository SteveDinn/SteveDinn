- 👋 Hi, I’m @SteveDinn
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in open source projects that I can self-host to reduce my dependency on those big tech companies we all seem to use.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dotNET and python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much, unfortunately, I have a full time job programming for a largish corporation, andthat's about all I can handle right now.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - Mastodon: steve@social.dinn.ca
  - Email: I'm sure you can figure it out from my Mastodon handle.
